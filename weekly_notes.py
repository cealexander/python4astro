# ideas for future meetings

# -- movies! 

# -- reading in data cubes

# -- lists vs arrays

# -- reading text files, skipping header lines.

# -- colors! maps and line colors :)

# -- image processing - box-car!!!


from numarray.convolve import boxcar

sflux = boxcar(data, (100,)) # smooth flux array







# order of arrays
# notation





# need to download 
ffmpeg






#array.reshape() ie. rebin

#axis =  instead of dim =


# python .sav equivalent pickle?  --> save as fits?






###### add to cheat sheet

# precision on %f stuff

# how to quickly close all windows   plt.close('all')

# how to pause programs








# next time - fits files

# use different types of compression, level 0
# cubes!
# practice pickling things!
# pandas




# Group Project!!!
# make a list of functions that are useful for IDL equivalent functions


# for Jan 22
# debugging
# line continuation - done
# Mitzi will send round temperature data + notes for opening. TASK: look over, make graphs :)
